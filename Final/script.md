Your name is Robin and you work as a park ranger here at Aokigahara Park. There's been a recent spat of missing people. Weeks later you find them, rotting in the underbrush, hanging in the boughs. Aokigahara has recently places signs asking would be suicide victims to reconsider in addition to having rangers approach and attempt to reason with anyone who may seem depressed or suicidally inclined. You don't really know how well it works, the bodies still show up, but you and your fellow rangers now actively patrol the forest paths.

As you travel through the shaded paths you find tourists of all sorts enjoying the peace and quiet. You greet some and ask if they need anything, careful all the while to see if any seem down or too lost in thought to hold a conversation. They assure you they're fine and are enjoying the serenity of the forest. You smile and move on.

Most of the day goes by without incident until you reach Lake Aoisora. There you find an older man, sitting at the very edge of the dilapidated pier.

You continue your patrol of the lake side, all the while keeping an eye on the old man. After you finish your circuit you see he hasn't moved from his spot.

Gathering yourself you move to approach him,  dunk-dunk noises fill the cool air as you move down the pier.

Finally you find yourself just behind him, you open your mouth to greet him, before catching yourself. You know you're going to ask him

"What are you doing all the way over here? Are you alright?"

But the delivery is key...What emotion do you want to color your tone?

joy +Good
trust +Good
fear +bad
surprise +Good
sadness +bad
disgust +bad
anger +bad
anticipation +bad

The old man whirls around, but as your words register he calms down.

"Oh hello there, I'm just enjoying the peace and quiet."

Good: "Ah, you're worried I might harm myself? Worry not, I'm fin-." He pauses midesentece and avoids your gaze. A moment passess then another before he gathers himself. 

"I think I may have been considering it..." He laughs to himself, sheepish and contrite.


Bad: "Ah...I don't know what you're thinking I'm going to do, but I'm not hurting anyone by sitting here." He glares at your for a second, before he sighs, eyes still closed he addresses you.

"I wasn't going to do it, drowning sounds like a terrible way to go. It's like when you're on top of a skyscraper and you suddenly feel like jumping. You entertain it, but you don't do it.

He opens his eyes and says "I'm fine ranger." 

The old man stands, and sticks his hand out. 'Where are my manners? You can call me Roy.'
